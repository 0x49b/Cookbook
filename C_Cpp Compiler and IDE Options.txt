These are some of the recommended editors for various platforms.

C/C++ Compiler options


Cross platform
--------------
gcc
clang


Windows
------------
Microsoft Visual C++
*Code::Blocks has a Windows download that comes with mingw gcc packaged in
*QtCreator can do MinGW





My recommendations:

Windows:
These come with compilers packaged making setup much easier. NetBeans, 
- Code::Blocks (for easy install, packaged with mingw gcc if Windows)
- QtCreator
- Eclipse
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community with MSCV compiler (if targeting Windows only)
For manual setup/alternatives
- MinGW/MSYS2 self install, manually configure any editor like VSCode
- Windows Subsystem for Linux, to use and compile to Linux environment

Linux:
- Eclipse
- QtCreator
- Code::Blocks



Cross platform
