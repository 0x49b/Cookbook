Intro



Sqlite3 (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org" target="_blank">https://www.sqlite.org</a>) is a relational database written in C. The main thing that stands out about Sqlite versus other databases is the fact that the whole database is contained in a single file. This makes it very easy to get started. There is no server to set up, just the file. It is easy to swap databases and make backups. Starting fresh or sharing databases is also very convenient.


Reads can be done concurrently but there is a database-wide lock for write events. For that reason, it does not perform well under write-heavy applications. A database that provides row-level locking would be more efficient for performing lots of concurrent writes.

Sqlite has proven to be stable in production environments, but is often used for development environments. There are language bindings to Sqlite written in almost every language. It is very ubiquitous.

The drawback is that the database lacks some features. For example, there is no authentication at all.

It is transactional.


It uses a mostly SQL compliant language so if you are familiar with any other standard SQL engine the language should be something you are familiar with. https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html
