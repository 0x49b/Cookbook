Creating a pip package

Create a folder for your module. Should be lowercase and underscores.

Create a setup.py in the base directory.

from setuptools import setup
setup(name='package_name',
      version='0.1.1',
      description='Description.',
      url='https://github.com/NanoDano/package_name',
      author='NanoDano',
      author_email='nanodano@devdungeon.com',
      license='MIT',
      packages=['package_name'],  # The folder with the real code
      scripts=['bin/executable'], # List of executable scripts to include
      zip_safe=False,
      install_requires=['dependency_package'])

Create the folder with the real code: <package_name>
Create an __init__.py in the new folder and have it import all the things from that directory:
from .some_file import SomeClass


Add scripts to the bin folder. Put a shebang so it is handled properly.

index-servers=pypi

[pypi]
