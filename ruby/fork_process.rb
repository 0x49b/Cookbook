# waitpid(pid=-1, flags=0) â†’ fixnum
# Waits for a child process to exit, returns its process id, and sets $? to a Process::Status object containing information on that process. Which child it waits on depends on the value of pid:
#
# > 0
# Waits for the child whose process ID equals pid.
#
# 0
# Waits for any child whose process group ID equals that of the calling process.
#
# -1
# Waits for any child process (the default if no pid is given).
#
# < -1
# Waits for any child whose process group ID equals the absolute value of pid.
#
#
#
#
# time example
# fork,
#   if child process, exec(replacing self)
#   if parent, waitpid(child), keep track of time
# print time waited
