# History search/replace
      ^string1^string2^ Quick substitution. Repeat the last command, replacing string1 with
      string2. Equivalent to ``!!:s/string1/string2/''

# History tricks
make a directory then move into it:
mkdir cgi-bin; cd !#$ 
!#$ is shorthand for "the first word of this command". If I wanted to pick the third word
out of the previous command, that would be: !!:3 (don't forget there is a zeroth word).

# Execute the most recent command the contains the following string: 
!?string

# Globally search replace on the previous line:
!!:gs/old/new/

# Searching the history
Ctrl-R starts a reverse incremental search 

# Reuse long prefixes
It's named !#:1:h like:
cp /usr/local/etc/apache/file1.txt !#:1:h/file2.txt !#:1:h/file3.txt

# Example of a basic command line script
for f in `ls | grep -v "\.sh$"`; { mv ${f} ${f}.sh; }
