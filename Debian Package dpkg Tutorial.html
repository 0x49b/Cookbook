<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>This tutorial covers the basics of creating custom .deb packages and managing them with <b>dpkg</b> and <b>apt-get</b>. We will cover the process of creating your own <b>.deb</b> file to distribute your package easily. It is aimed at people who are interested in learning the basics of creating and managing packages in Debian, and derivatives like Ubuntu and Kali Linux.</p>

<p>A <b>.deb</b> file is a Debian package, but really it is just a standard Unix archive (ar) file. The <b>dpkg</b> tool is the Debian package manager and <b>apt-get</b> is a higher level command-line tool for managing packages which uses <b>dpkg</b> under the hood to manage dependencies and pull from remote repositories.</p>

                                        Extract control info and files.
        --ctrl-tarfile <deb>             Output control tarfile.
        --fsys-tarfile <deb>             Output filesystem tarfile.

<h2>Create a custom .deb package file</h2>

https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html


<p>To start fresh, create a new directory. This directory will store the package metadata and the package contents. Inside the project directory, there needs to be one special directory with one special file: <b>DEBIAN/control</b>.</p>

<p>Create a new directory for the project. For this example, we will use the directory <b>mypkg/</b>. Inside the <b>mypkg/</b> directory, create a folder named DEBIAN. Inside that folder create a file named <b>control</b>.</p>


<code></pre>
    # Minimum required directory structure for a package
    mypkg            # Directory
    └── DEBIAN       # Directory
        └── control  # File
</pre></code>

<p>Below is a minimal example of the contents for the <b>control</b> file in the <b>DEBIAN</b> directory.</p>

<pre><code>
Package: mypkg
Version: 1.0.0
Maintainer: Your Name <you@example.com>
Description: My test package, please ignore
Homepage: https://github.com/username/projectname
Architecture: all
Depends: git, python3 (>=3.5), openjdk-8-jre-headless|openjdk-8-jre|openjdk-8-jdk-headless|openjdk-8-jdk
</code></pre>

<p>The code above is the minimum required contents for the <b>control</b> file. The <b>Depends</b> line is actually optional, but frequently needed. The example above shows how to add multiple dependencies, how to specify a minimum version with python3, and how to add a dependency that is satisfied by one of many options. There are version of java listed. If any one of them are installed it will be satisfied. If none of them are installed, it will start from the first one in the list and try to install it. This way, it will work if the user has version 8 of the JDK or JRE in full or headless variant. If none of them are installed it will install the smallest version (the headless jre).</p>

<p>Build the package by running <b>dpkg -b</b> on the project directory like this:</p>

<pre><code>
    # Build mypkg directory in to .deb package
    dpkg -b ./mypkg ./mypkg.deb

    # Print information like size, version, dependencies
    dpkg -I mypkg.deb
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
# Example output of `dpkg -I mypkg.deb`

new debian package, version 2.0.
size 666 bytes: control archive=301 bytes.
    238 bytes,     6 lines      control
Package: mypkg
Version: 1.0.0
Maintainer: Your Name <you@example.com>
Description: My test package, please ignore
Architecture: all
Depends: git, python3 (>= 3.5), openjdk-8-jre-headless|openjdk-8-jre|openjdk-8-jdk-headless|openjdk-8-jdk      
</code></pre>

<p>It's a special little package, but it's lonely without any files to install. Normally a package has some contents like a shared library, documentation, an executable program, or 


<p>The next thing we'll need to do is add files to the package. Typically, you will add things like an executable or a shell script launcher in the /usr/bin/ directory, man pages in /usr/share/man, configuration files in /etc/, libraries in /usr/lib, header files in /usr/include, or other miscellaneous files. In this example, we'll add a shell launch script for a Java JAR file.</p>

/usr/bin/mylauncher

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# Convenient launch script for JAR
java -jar /usr/share/java/myapp.jar "$@"

    add files
        add /usr/bin launch scripts, chmod +x minus write
        create /var/log dir and chown user:user it and chmod it
        post install script
    

<p>If you want to review the contents of a <b>.deb</b> package before installing it, you can print the contents with the <b>-c</b> flag. If you want to extract the contents of a .deb file, use the <b>-X</b> flag for verbose extraction, or <b>-x</b> for quiet extraction.</p>

<pre><code>
    # Print the contents of a .deb package. 
    dpkg -c mypkg.deb

    # Extract .deb contents to a directory
    dpkg -X mypkg.deb ./extracted_contents/
</code></pre>

# Example output of: dpkc -c mypkg.deb

<pre><code>

</code></pre>

2) recreate folder strucutre of root system


conffiles (for remove/purge command, so package updates don't replace your config files)

/etc/myapp.conf
/var/log/myapp/
/usr/bin/myapp
/usr/share/x
/usr/lib/x
/usr/include/x
/usr/share/man/myapp.1

# Adding dependencies like jre
# Post install scripts
# Adding/creating bin scripts (like java -jar myjar)

then dpkg-deb --build ./mypackage/? [output-v.deb?]

Example uses:
Hello world package
installing a java .jar with a shell launcher, man page
?installing a C lib with man page, share, include/?
?install a service (like chattycathy, minecraft)
installing a tomcat web app that listens on a port like phpmyadmin
a documentation package - /usr/share/doc - html/asciidocs/pdf?man pages?a cli tool with doc help?



Other useful configs
Package relationship: Depends, Recommends, Suggests, Breaks, Conflicts, Provides, Replaces, Enhances # Useful to warn people if your package will break another one or conflicts with something that is already installed. You can also replace or enhance existing packages. If other packages would make your package work better, you can recommend and suggest other packages when the user installs your package.

<a name="install_deb_package"></a>
<h2>Install a package</h2>

<p>Usually, two options are available for installing .deb packages. One is <b>dpkg</b> and the other is <b>apt-get</b> which is built on top of <b>dpkg</b>.

<p>If you don't have the dependencies installed you will have to install them yourself if you use <b>dpkg -i</b>. Alternatively, you can use <b>apt-get</b>. I recommend using <b>apt-get</b> because it still uses <b>dpkg</b> under the hood, but it handles dependencies and is more user-friendly.</p>

<pre><code>
    # Install package along with any dependencies it needs
    sudo apt-get install ./mypkg.deb

    # Install package, ignore and warn about unmet dependencies
    sudo dpkg -i mypkg.deb

    # If you need to install dependencies that were not
    # installed because you used `dpkg -i` instead of `apt-get install`
    sudo apt-get --fix-broken install
    
    # Get status of package
    dpkg -s mypkg  
</code></pre>

note about apt-get and apt-cache search and repos#dpkg -? apt-get to see where config files are /etc/?

verify pakage is installed by checking the status with

    



Update packages
- reinstall file with dpkg/apt-get






<h2>List installed packages</h2>

List all installed packages with:

<pre><code>
    # List all installed packages
    dpkg -l
    # Get status of specific package
    dpkg -s mypkg
</code></pre>
    

if you have a file on your system and you want to see if it belongs to a package-- "What package uses this /etc/qwerty.conf file? dpkg -S /etc/qwerty.conf"
-S|--search <pattern> ...        Find package(s) owning file(s).
        
        

<h2>Uninstall a package</h2>

    remove vs purge
    config files

    dpkg and apt-get

creating your own deb repo? installing a .deb from remote? adding it to apt list? (its just an http docroot?)


<h2>Security</h2>

Use trusted packages and repositories only.
