Windows Desktop Notification in Python

simple Notification
with image?

<p>This guide is aimed at Windows, and the first few examples are for Windows only, but some of the solutions are cross-platform and will work on Linux. For Linux notifications with libnotify, check out my tutorial <a href="/content/desktop-notifications-linux-python">Desktop Notifications in Linux with Python</a>.</p>

Intro

Tested with Python 3.6 in Windows 10
Official docs/pypi page/github





# win10toast option (simple interface, but limited)

pip install win10toast  
# Under the hood it uses pywin32 package
# https://github.com/jithurjacob/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications


<pre><code>
# pip install win10toast
from win10toast import ToastNotifier

# One-time initialization
toaster = ToastNotifier()

toaster.show_toast("Notification!", "You have been alerted.")
# Program is blocked until the notification is complete (about 5 seconds)
# The notification will go away after that time. It will not remain in the notification bar
</code></pre>


<pre><code>
from win10toast import ToastNotifier
toaster = ToastNotifier()

# thread it in the background so it doesn't block program execution
toaster.show_toast("Example two",
                   "This notification is in it's own thread!",
                   threaded=True)
# check if a notification thread is active
    # Wait for threaded notification to finish
    while toaster.notification_active(): time.sleep(0.1)


# change icon
toaster.show_toast("Hello World!!!",
                   "Python is 10 seconds awsm!",
                   icon_path='C:\\Users\\DTron\\Dropbox\\DevDungeon Stuff\\resources\\images\\favicon_32x32.ico')
                   
                    # does a .png work? any size?

# Change how long it lasts
toaster.show_toast("Hello World!!!",
                   "Python is 10 seconds awsm!",
                   duration=10)
</code></pre>


Cross platform plyer
plyer does a lot more than notifications

# pip install plyer
from plyer import notification

notification.notify(
    title='Here is the title',
    message='Here is the message',
    app_name='Here is the application name',
    app_icon='C:\\Users\\DTron\\Dropbox\\DevDungeon Stuff\\resources\\images\\favicon_32x32.ico'
)



PyQt5 option

Note that Qt5 is a huge GUI library and more. It has a ton of features and is a big dependency.
it's tied to the system tray icon so you have to create a system tray icon
