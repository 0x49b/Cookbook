x gpg basics tutorial?
gpg --help and man pages

intro (diff between pgp and gpg?)
what is gpg and why use it
installation apt-get install gnugp gpg
Key management
 listing what keys are stored (secret and non-secret)
 create a new private key
 export a private key
 import a private key
 generate public key from private key
 export your public key
 push key to pub server

now you can use this key to sign, encrypt, use Maven to sign things for you, just configure maven gpg plugin with the name of your key
 
<!-- Encryption
Other use cases (exercises for the reader):
    Encrypt/decrypt a file symmetrically (with password)
    Encrypt for specific recipent only
    Decrypt / verify sender
    sign(Detached/attached), verify signature
    Sending/receiving encrypted emails (cli examples)
-->
(( check out maven basics tutorial ))
<!-- (( check out turoail on using maven central -- they require gpg signed stuff)) -->

(( pitch my book for info on crypto/security with Go language. ))

Mention gpg language libraries - py, go, java, c

Conclusion
    ( now you have a private key and a public key)

<!-- --------------------------- -->
















what is gpg and why use it
- encrypt things
- if you want to push things to maven central
- can use to send secure emails
- mention email client plugins




- See which keys are stored, public and private

    gpg --list-keys
    gpg --list-secret-keys

- Or create a new private key

    gpg --gen-key


- Export a private key

    # Find the id of your key
    # The ID is the 8 digit hexadecimal number in the second column after the slash (/)
    gpg --list-secret-keys 
    
    # This is your private key keep it secret!
    gpg --export-secret-keys --armor XXXXXXXX > ./my-priv-gpg-key.asc

# Omitting the --armor flag will give you binary output,
# which will result in a slightly smaller file but the ASCII
# formatted (armored) can be printed physically, is human readable,
# and transfered digitally easier.

- delete a key
    # use the same id listed with --list-secret-keys that was used to export
    gpg --delete-secret-keys XXXXXXXX

- Import an existing private key if you already have one

    gpg --import ./my-priv-gpg-key.bin

- Make sure key is somewhere public like MIT's public key server

You share your public key - why? explain

    gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --send-keys XXXXXXXX

revocation certificate?
running your own gpg server?
trusted rings?
